# Log example 1

Some log files from a test run of the software for Climb! 

Note that I just played a few (virtual) MIDI notes, and simulated triggering codes from the muzicodes UI. Note also that this version of Climb! is incomplete. There are no accompanying audio or video files as I didn't actually play it :-)

I progressed through the stages: 
- basecamp
- 1b (the stones)
- p2a (path 2a)
- summit (forced transition without a code) - Note that this triggered a vStop emit rather than a vStageChange, marking the nominal end of the performance.

The muzicode log is 20170517T135220963Z-default.log. The format is partially documented in [logformat.md](https://github.com/cgreenhalgh/musiccodes/blob/master/docs/logformat.md).

This was generated by Musicodes commit 0dc93f1543d7a7cc7106158380fe8a36b7404aeb Wed May 17 11:19:47 2017 +0100. It includes the (untested) support for the mobile app (see [appnotes.md](https://github.com/cgreenhalgh/fast-performance-demo/blob/master/docs/appnotes.md).

Some of the most useful/obvious events are:
- `midi.note` - notes played by the pianist (excludes sequenced notes from the disklavier part)
- `action.emit` with `info.message`=`vStart` - nominal start of piece (used by mobile app), triggered indirectly by pianist pressing "start the climb" in the Meld interface.
- `action.emit` with `info.message`=`vStageChange` - nominal transition from one stage to another (used by mobile app), triggered indirectly by pianist pressing next page at the end of a stage in the Meld interface.
- `action.emit` with `info.message`=`vStop` - nominal end of piece  (used by mobile app), triggered indirectly by pianist pressing next page at the end of the last "real" stage in the Meld interface.
- `actionTriggered` with `info.code` defined = musicode triggered
- `actionTriggered` with `info.inputUrl` = `delay:{{WEATHER}}` = start of weather
- `input` with `info.inputUrl` = `post:meld.load` = new score loaded in meld view, `info.params` include `meldcollection` URI (cross-refer to Meld collection file), `meldannostate` URI (cross-refer to Meld annostate file) and `meldmei` score URL.

The experience file used by muzicodes is mkGameEngine2-out.json. This was generated from the spreadsheet mkGameEngine2.xlsx (which lists the stages of piece, associated music files, muzicodes, etc.) and mkGameEngine2-config.yml (which specifies some other general configuration).

The version of meld was [cgreenhalgh](https://github.com/cgreenhalgh/meld)'s, branch `mpm`. Interaction between muzicodes and meld is as per [meldnotes.md](https://github.com/cgreenhalgh/fast-performance-demo/blob/master/docs/meldnotes.md). The Meld logs are in the subscriptions, collections and annostate subdirectories.

The main event(s) in the Meld logs and not in the Musicodes log are the page turn events. E.g. `collection/3hCrwFuaK5iuVJiGM62M8B` `meldterm:NextPageOrPiece` annotations.
